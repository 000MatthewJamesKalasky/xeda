# Main code

[ ] Idea: Some code in Suite should be refactored to a FlowRunner class, suites/flows? should provide a run method.
[ ] parallel runs
[ ] move DSE code to a plugin


# Plugins

## LWC plugins

[ ] LwcSim post_run should actually do the `regexp` on stdout and/or check results.txt
[ ] LwcSim replicate settings 
[ ] LwcSynth post_results: 1. check for usage of forbidden resources 2. only keep relevant data
